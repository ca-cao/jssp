abstract = {Many recently developed local search procedures for job shop scheduling use interchange of operations, embedded in a simulated annealing or tabu search framework. We develop a new variable depth search procedure, GLS (Guided Local Search), based on an interchange scheme and using the new concept of neighborhood trees. Structural properties of the neighborhood are used to guide the search in promising directions. While this procedure competes successfully with others even as a stand-alone, a hybrid procedure that embeds GLS into a Shifting Bottleneck framework and takes advantage of the differences between the two neighborhood structures proves to be particularly efficient. We report extensive computational testing on all the problems available from the literature.},

abstract = {Job-shop scheduling problem (abbreviated to JSP) is one of the well-known hardest combinatorial optimization problems. During the last three decades, the problem has captured the interest of a significant number of researchers and a lot of literature has been published, but no efficient solution algorithm has been found yet for solving it to optimality in polynomial time. This has led to recent interest in using genetic algorithms (GAs) to address it. The purpose of this paper and its companion (Part II: Hybrid Genetic Search Strategies) is to give a tutorial survey of recent works on solving classical JSP using genetic algorithms. In Part I, we devote our attention to the representation schemes proposed for JSP. In Part II, we will discuss various hybrid approaches of genetic algorithms and conventional heuristics. The research works on GA/JSP provide very rich experiences for the constrained combinatorial optimization problems. All of the techniques developed for JSP may be useful for other scheduling problems in modern flexible manufacturing systems and other combinatorial optimization problems.

This book breaks away from this tradition and provides a comprehensive overview on the influence of problem representations on GEA performance. The book summarizes existing knowledge regarding problem representations and describes how basic properties of representations, such as redundancy, scaling, or locality, influence the performance of GEAs and other heuristic optimization methods. Using the developed theory, representations can be analyzed and designed in a theory-guided matter. The theoretical concepts are used for solving integer optimization problems and network design problems more efficiently. The book is written in an easy-to-read style and is intended for researchers, practitioners, and students who want to learn about representations.

Computational experience with the algorithms shows that it is practical, in problems of small size, to generate the complete set of all active schedules and to pick the optimal schedules directly from this set and, when this is not practical, to random sample from the bet of all active schedules and, thus, to produce schedules that are optimal with a probability as close to unity as is desired.

Specifically, we investigate how the expected values of (1) backbone size, (2) distance between near-optimal schedules, and (3) makespan of random schedules vary as a function of the job to machine ratio (N/M). For the limiting cases N/M → 0 and N/M → ∞ we provide analytical results, while for intermediate values of N/M we perform experiments. We prove that as N/M → 0, backbone size approaches 100%, while as N/M → ∞ the backbone vanishes. In the process we show that as N/M → 0 (resp. N/M → ∞), simple priority rules almost surely generate an optimal schedule, providing theoretical evidence of an "easy-hard-easy" pattern of typical-case instance difficulty in job shop scheduling.

We give a survey of the nowadays most important metaheuristics from a conceptual point of view. We outline the different components and concepts that are used in the different metaheuristics in order to analyze their similarities and differences. Two very important concepts in metaheuristics are intensification and diversification. These are the two forces that largely determine the behavior of a metaheuristic. They are in some way contrary but also complementary to each other. We introduce a framework, that we call the I&D frame, in order to put different intensification and diversification components into relation with each other. Outlining the advantages and disadvantages of different metaheuristic approaches we conclude by pointing out the importance of hybridization of metaheuristics as well as the integration of metaheuristics and other methods for optimization.},

abstract = {The Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) has drawn considerable interest during the last decades, mainly because of its combinatorial characteristics, which make it very difficult to solve. The good performances attained by local search procedures, and especially Nowicki and Smutnicki's i-TSAB algorithm, encouraged researchers to combine such local search engines with global methods. Differential Evolution (DE) is an Evolutionary Algorithm that has been found to be particularly efficient for continuous optimization, but which does not usually perform well when applied to permutation problems. We introduce in this paper the idea of hybridizing DE with Tabu Search (TS) in order to solve the JSSP. A competitive neighborhood is included within the TS with the aim of determining if DE is able to replace the re-start features that constitute the main strengths of i-TSAB (i.e., a long-term memory and a path-relinking procedure). The computational experiments reported for more than 100 JSSP instances show that the proposed hybrid DE-TS algorithm is competitive with respect to other state-of-the-art techniques, although, there is still room for improvement if the adequacy between the solution representation modes within DE and TS is properly stressed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Firstly, a multi-agent genetic algorithm (MAGA) is proposed. During the process, a multi-agent grid environment is constructed based on characteristics of multi-agent systems and genetic algorithm (GA), and a corresponding neighbor interaction operator, a mutation operator based on neighborhood structure and a self-learning operator are designed.

abstract = {Metaheuristics provide the means to approximately solve complex optimisation problems when exact optimisers cannot be utilised. This led to an explosion in the number of novel metaheuristics, most of them metaphor-based, using nature as a source of inspiration. Thus, keeping track of their capabilities and innovative components is an increasingly difficult task. This can be resolved by an exhaustive classification system. Trying to classify metaheuristics is common in research, but no consensus on a classification system and the necessary criteria has been established so far. Furthermore, a proposed classification system can not be deemed complete if inherently different metaheuristics are assigned to the same class by the system. In this paper we provide the basis for a new comprehensive classification system for metaheuristics. We first summarise and discuss previous classification attempts and the utilised criteria. Then we present a multi-level architecture and suitable criteria for the task of classifying metaheuristics. A classification system of this kind can solve three main problems when applied to metaheuristics: organise the huge set of existing metaheuristics, clarify the innovation in novel metaheuristics and identify metaheuristics suitable to solve specific optimisation tasks.},

abstract = {Stuart Kauffman here presents a brilliant new paradigm for evolutionary biology, one that extends the basic concepts of Darwinian evolution to accommodate recent findings and perspectives from the fields of biology, physics, chemistry and mathematics. The book drives to the heart of the exciting debate on the origins of life and maintenance of order in complex biological systems. It focuses on the concept of self-organization: the spontaneous emergence of order that is widely observed throughout nature Kauffman argues that self-organization plays an important role in the Darwinian process of natural selection. Yet until now no systematic effort has been made to incorporate the concept of self-organization into evolutionary theory. The construction requirements which permit complex systems to adapt are poorly understood, as is the extent to which selection itself can yield systems able to adapt more successfully. This book explores these themes. It shows how complex systems, contrary to expectations, can spontaneously exhibit stunning degrees of order, and how this order, in turn, is essential for understanding the emergence and development of life on Earth. Topics include the new biotechnology of applied molecular evolution, with its important implications for developing new drugs and vaccines; the balance between order and chaos observed in many naturally occurring systems; new insights concerning the predictive power of statistical mechanics in biology; and other major issues. Indeed, the approaches investigated here may prove to be the new center around which biological science itself will evolve. The work is written for all those interested in the cutting edge of research in the life sciences.},

In this paper, a new enhanced neighborhood structure is proposed and applied to solving the job shop scheduling problem by TS approach. Using this new neighborhood structure combined with the appropriate move evaluation strategy and parameters, we tested the TS approach on a set of standard benchmark instances and found a large number of better upper bounds among the unsolved instances.

In order to transferring traditional scheduling into smart distributed scheduling (SDS), we aim to answer two questions: (1) what traditional scheduling methods and techniques can be combined and reused in SDS and (2) what are new methods and techniques required for SDS.
